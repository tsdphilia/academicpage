<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a BSc student in Data Science and Big Data Technology at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), with a GPA of 3.979/4.300 (Rank: 1/137) and on the Dean's List for three semesters.

My research interest includes the intersection between neuroscience and machine learning, with a focus on understanding human perception and recognition. I am currently working on a project for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction using Visual Foundation Models.

I am seeking a challenging yet meaningful opportunity to contribute to further understanding human perception and recognition, as I prepare for future PhD studies in relevant fields.

[IMTS is Worth Time × Channel Patches: Visual Masked Autoencoders for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction](https://github.com)

[**Project**](https://github.com)
- This project addresses irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) prediction challenges with unaligned signals and massive missing values by leveraging visual pretrained masked autoencoders, converting sparse data into time × channel image-like patches.
- As a core contributor, I engaged in discussions to use self-supervised learning strategy for data efficient training, designed and executed the majority of experiments, and co-authored the Introduction, Experiment and Conclusion sections of the paper.
